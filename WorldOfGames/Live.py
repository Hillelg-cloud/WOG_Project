# Function Update
# 1. Change the function load_game() from the previous document that after it will get the
# userâ€™s game of choice and level of difficulty, it will start a new function of the
# corresponding game with the given difficulty. For example: If a user will choose the first
# option in load_game() function with difficulty 3, it will call the play() function from the
# module MemoryGame with difficulty of 3.
# 2. Change the 3rd game description on load_game() function to: Currency Roulette - try
# and guess the value of a random amount of USD in ILS
